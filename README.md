# SWAPI-Box
## By: Jonathan Sweet

## Description:
SWAPI-Box is a Turing School project utilizing the StarWars API. The purpose of this project was to gain experience with using and testing asynchronous javascript. This app is bootstrapped with Create-React-App and uses React-Router. To limit stress on the StarWars API and decrease loading times, categorical data is stored in localStorage along with objects corresponding to the vehicles, planets, and people that the user has favorited. On initial page load or when the user returns to the home screen, a random "opening crawl" from one of the seven movies in the database is displayed and animated to look similar to an actual movie.

## Setup
1. Clone down this repository
2. Install the project dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the application with `npm start`
4. Testing suite can be run with `npm test`
